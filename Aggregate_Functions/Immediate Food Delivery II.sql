/*If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. 
It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.
Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.*/
